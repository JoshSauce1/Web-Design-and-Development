<p> My name is Joshua Abreu</p>

<p> When I am not coding, I like to play sports like basketball and workout with my freinds.
Some of my favorite shows are breaking bad, as well as game of thrones. I have two cats and one dog. </p>

<!-- I got into coding because my father also worked on computers,
he passed away 3 years ago and I want to continue his legacy -->
